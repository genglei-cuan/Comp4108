# In-class Questions

### Describe m attacks and n defenses. For each, say when they would be "suitable". (Potentially give a list of each to choose from.)



### Describe a real-life example of functionality versus security. How did security compromise functionality? What attempt was made to minimize the impact of security? What alternatives would there be to reconcile this conflict?



### Compare and contrast two similar security technologies (attacks or defences), emphasizing their relative strengths and weakness in the context of a specific thereat model. Be sure to describe the threat model and focus on specific implementations.



### Explain the evolution of the reference monitor from Multics to current-day operating systems.



### If you would design your own secure OS, what mechanisms would you include and why.



### Alternately, what security mechanism would you add to the primary OS that you use on a daily basis. What threats(s) would this mechanism address and how effective would this mechanism be in thwarting those threats, given your usage patterns?



### In the far, far dystopian future, users who fail to authenticate successfully to their home security system are fatally electrocuted. Describe possible attacks, defenses, and how it would impact the end user.



### Choose an offensive network security tool. Explain its functionality briefly and analyze its effectiveness in the context of a specific defensive scenario.



### You are the new security officer of a law firm that has a number of clients who require great levels of discretion. As part of your initial audit, you discover that the authentication database was compromised some tie ago. The passwords were hashed "well" (e.g., bcrypt with many rounds). You run a password cracker (e.g., Hashcat) using the default settings for a week using a cluster of 1000 top of the line systems. You crack none of the passwords. You verify that the cracker is working properly. What do you tell management and why? Be sure to make your answer understandable to your bosses...otherwise you're going to get fired.



### Outline an attack strategy for a particular target. Be sure to consider all phases of the attack (getting in, accomplishing your goal, covering your tracks). Then, outline how you would defend against that attack strategy.



### Aleph One outlined a classic buffer overflow attack. What is one mechanism that prevents such naive attacks from succeeding on most current systems? How does it stop the attack? What is a way to circumvent that protection (and thus make the attack work again)?



# Midterm Questions

### Give a review of a security tool that you have used (for attack or defense). What is the tool? What is its purpose? To what extent does it achieve that purpose? What is its quality, in terms of functionality, reliability, and usability? Support your answer with specifics from your experiences with the tool.


### For an operating system of your choosing, to what extent is it a secure operating system? Specifically, does it implement a reference monitor, and is that reference monitor offer complete mediation, is tamperproof, and is verifiable? Be specific. You may refer to hardware features where applicable (but it is not required).


### For two systems where authorized users, and only authorized users, should have access to information (read, write, or both) stored on a system, describe the following: (Rather than discuss two separate systems and two separate threats, you may discuss one system; however, you must discuss two distinct threats and two distinct mechanisms (one for each)).

#### What is the system?



#### What is a specific security threat the system faces? Remember this threat may involve matters of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The threat may be hypothetical; it just needs to be plausible given the environment the system is designed or deployed for.



#### For this threat, what is one security mechanism that provides at least a partial defense against this threat?



#### To what extent is your chosen mechanismâ€™s effectiveness potentially compromised due to user and system administrator choices?



#### To what extent do you think there are vulnerabilities in the mechanism that could cause it to fail catastrophically?
